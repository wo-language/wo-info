### Wo is a fork of Go

This repo is to store extra general information about Wo. I want to make everything I worked on with this public.

---

The Wo language is an interoperable successor to Go. It offers alternative syntax and language features aimed at readability.

For example,

```go
f, err := os.Open("hi.wo")
if err != nil {
    return nil, err
}
```

would be done like this in Wo:

```go
var file = os.Open!("hi.wo")
```


### Trademark disclaimer

All activity here should follow all of Go's guidelines at https://go.dev/brand/. If they inform me that anything violates it, then I will quickly comply. It is also preferable to follow https://go.dev/conduct

Do not refer to Wo as anything other than "a fork of Go" at least not in any way that could disparage the Go programming language.
