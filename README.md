### Wo is a fork of Go

This repo is to store extra general information about Wo. I want to make everything I worked on with this public.

[See more here.](https://github.com/wo-language/wo/tree/release-branch.go1.23.wo?tab=readme-ov-file#wo-is-a-fork-of-go)

---

The Wo language is an interoperable successor to Go. It offers alternative syntax and language features aimed at readability.

For example,

```go
f, err := os.Open("hi.wo")
if err != nil {
    return nil, err
}
```

would be done like this in Wo:

```go
var file = os.Open("hi.wo")!
```
